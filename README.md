# simpleJsCopy :clipboard:

Just include the library (`v0.1.3`, under 1kB!):

    //cdn.rawgit.com/ryanpcmcquen/simpleJsCopy/eb7fcfd94ed9988ed5099b6e9c1cb42f701ac32a/simpleJsCopy.min.js

Then use the following elements:

1. `<textarea>` with the class `text-to-copy` (can be `readonly` but *not* `disabled`)
2. `<button>` with the class `js-copy-btn`

The library takes cares of the rest. :shipit:

:newspaper: You don't have to write any JavaScript to use it!

=====

#### So what?! Where does it work?

Almost everywhere!

Desktop:

- Chrome/Chromium 42+
- Firefox 41+
- Internet Explorer 9+
- Opera 29+

Android:

- Chrome 42+
- Firefox 41+

##### What about other browsers?

Everywhere else (meaning iOS), it will select the text. The library detects iDevices and will say either `Now tap 'Copy'` (iPhone) or `Now tap the text, then 'Copy'` (iPad), to account for the strange behavioral differences of these devices.

On desktop Safari (any version), the button will change to `Press Command + C to copy`.

On failure the button will say `Please copy manually`.

=====

:warning: If you want your textarea to be invisible for some reason, use this CSS:

```css
.text-to-copy {
  opacity: 0;
  position: absolute;
}
```

Because it will not work with `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;`. :thumbsup:

Note that you should also supplement that CSS with something like this helper library, otherwise people on iOS will not be able to copy at all since Safari doesn't support cool stuff:
